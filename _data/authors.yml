  about:             |
    I am a post-doctoral researcher in computational biology at [Institut Curie](https://sysbio.curie.fr/index.html). I work in the analysis of omics data based on biological networks and develop methodological and computational methods to investigate the molecular basis of cancer disease. In particular, I  am involved in the European [individualized Paediatric Cure](https://ipc-project.eu/) project.
    
    In July 2019, I obtained my Ph.D. in Life Sciences from the [Université Paris-Saclay](https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/). My work *Mathematical modelling and integration of complex biological data: analysis of the heterosis phenomenon in yeast* was carryed out at the laboratory [Génétique Quantitative et Evolution - Le Moulon](http://moulon.inra.fr/) under the supervision of Christine Dillmann and Dominique de Vienne.
        
    My research interests resides at the interface between biology and quantitative sciences, and more specifically between mathematics, genetics and computational sciences. It is particularly interesting and challenging to me to both apply and construct mathematical methods to forge an unifying understanding of complex biological systems that is now possible thanks to the high-throughput production of different types of biological data.
