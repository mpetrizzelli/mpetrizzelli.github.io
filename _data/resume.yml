  summary: >
    Marianyela hails from Valencia (Venezuela).
    She has earned degrees from the University of Trento, Politecnico of Turin and Université Paris-Saclay.
    Before starting Pied Piper, he worked for Hooli as a part time software developer.
    While his work focuses on applied information theory,
    mostly optimizing lossless compression schema of both the length-limited and adaptive variants,
    his non-work interests range widely,
    everything from quantum computing to chaos theory.
    He could tell you about it, but THAT would NOT be a “length-limited” conversation!

      My mission, within the Systems Computational Biology of cancer group, consists in the analysis of omics data based on biological networks, with application to pedriatic cancer. I am engaged to use and propose novel methodological and computational methods exploiting different omics data sets and bilogical networks to identify cancer signatures and perform patient stratification within the European individualized Pediatric Cancer (iPC) project.
      I performed advance statistical analysis of large complex omics datasets. I developed methods for multi-level data representation (multi-level networks) and integration (e.g., https://github.com/iPC-project-H2020/ipcrg/tree/master/scripts/data-driven_relational_graphs). I designed pipelines to analyze interaction networks of statistical associations among features (genes) and similarity networksamong observations (patients) (e.g., https://github.com/iPC-project-H2020/ wp4-deliverables/tree/main/D4.1/BMNPPSN). I created pipelines that integrates machine learning and optimization techniques to model cell metabolism. I collaborated with biologists, computational biologists, engineers, and physicists within the H2020-ICT-2018-2 projectindividualized Pediatric Cure project (https://ipc-project.eu/) to design algorithms that address Cancer specific questions. I produced a data catalog containing links to omics datasets linked to Ewing sarcoma (https://sysbio-curie.github.io/EwSOmicsAtlas/index.html).

      Second-year master research internship in population genetics, under the supervision of O. Martin. I developed a general model able to calculate the probabilities of multi-locus genotypes in brother and sister mating. I constructed the associated algorithm in R. I showed a practical application of the model for data imputation.

        I lead this interdisciplinary project at the interface between mathematics, statistics, and biology. It involved modeling and analysis of complex biological data. I performed multivariate analysis and clustering considering the cross design on which the data was measured. I constructed a unique statistical model and performed clustering analysis to disentangle hybrid vigor and inbreeding depression.
        I proposed a novel model to predict metabolic fluxes from proteomics data which involved an integrative approach.
