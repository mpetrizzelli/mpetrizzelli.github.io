I am Principal Data Scientist at Sanofi. My core interest lies in harnessing the power of advanced machine learning techniques to unravel the complexities of single-cell data. My focus is predominantly on the application of cutting-edge generative AI  to delve into the intricate networks of causality within biological systems. 

Previously, I spent 4 years as a postdoctoral researcher at [Institut Curie](https://curie.fr/) in the group [Computational Systems Biology of Cancer](https://sysbio.curie.fr/) inside the Bioinformatics of Cancer department. My work focused in understanding cancer disease using and developing network-based analysis of large complex omics datasets. I was particularly involved in the European project [individualized Pediatric Cure](https://ipc-project.eu/) where I developped computational pipelines to build cancer type-specific multi-layered molecular and patient similarity networks from multi-omics datasets and context-specific genome scale metabolic models from single-cell datasets. 

My education is interdisciplinary. I have a Bachelor degree in Mathematics from the [University of Trento](), an International Master degree in Physics of Complex Systems from the [Politecnico of Turin]() and a PhD in Life Science from [Universit√© Paris Saclay](). I did my Ph. D. in the laboratory [Quantitative Genetics and Evolution](http://moulon.inra.fr/) of Le Moulon under the supervision of Christine Dillmann and Dominique de Vienne on the subject "Mathematical modeling and integration of complex biological data: analysis of the heterosis phenomenon in yeast".
